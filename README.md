# Analysis of Momentum Portfolio performance with respect to changing interest rates

A momentum portfolio expects to take advantage of going long on assets which have been performing well from sometime. For investing purposese we will look at a long only portfolio.

Sometimes these portfolios tend to outperform the market while other times they fail. There can be many reasons behind it, we will try to look at it from interest rates' perspective

In the chart below we can see the performance of a monthly rebalanced momentum portfolio which invests in the same ratio as returns of top performing stocks(dark green). We compare it with the benchmark index (dashed orange)

In the light blue color in the background is the 10 Y benchmark bond yield (Indian in this experiment). For understanding the cycle the 2 years rolling yield has been shown in light orange

Hypothesis: When rates are on lower side, the momentum portfolio tends to outperform the benchmark

## TODO: 

1) Add more data to see a clear difference
2) Mark regions of interest rate cuts in the graph
3) Find a better way of representing the outperformence in the graph
